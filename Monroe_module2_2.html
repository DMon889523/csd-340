        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">I was born in Negril, Jamaica. At age 5, I moved to Chicago, IL. I currently reside in Syracuse, New York.</p>
        <p> My family consisted of my fiancee and myself for four years. My family has grown. As of Dec. 13, our firstborn was born. His name is Amir Grant Monroe.</p>
        <p>I consider myself an eclectic person. My hobbies range from being outdoors fishing and camping, to gaming online with friends. I have found a new interest in voice-over work. I have taken several courses and listened to podcasts and audiobooks about getting started in VO work as a hobby.</p>
        <p>I have several goals I would like to complete by the end of 2024. The first goal is the completion of school. This is the most important goal on my list. Another goal is to pay off my car and eliminate other forms of debt. Ultimately, I would like to be debt-free and worry-free after 2024. </p>
