        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">I was born in Negril, Jamaica. At age 5, I moved to Chicago, IL. I currently reside in Syracuse, New York.</p>
        <p> My family consisted of my fiancee and myself for four years. My family has grown. As of Dec. 13, our firstborn was born. His name is Amir Grant Monroe.
        I consider myself an eclectic person. My hobbies range from being outdoors fishing and camping, to gaming online with friends. I have found a new interest in voice-over work. I have taken several courses and listened to podcasts and audiobooks about getting started in VO work as a hobby.
        I have several goals I would like to complete by the end of 2024. The first goal is the completion of school. This is the most important goal on my list. Another goal is to pay off my car and eliminate other forms of debt. Ultimately, I would like to be debt-free and worry-free after 2024. </p>
        <p class="intro"> My love for anime started with Dragon Ball Z.</p>
        <p>Since the learning about anime, I have developed a love for animation, so much so that I considered a career in animation. As time has passed I have learned that like many things anime has it's own genres, slice of life, isekais(transport to another world), action, and romance; among others.
        My favorites among those are the isekais due to the person developing certain abilities and having to level up similar to that of a video game. I also enjoy the action animes due to the fight sequences that occur, I have alays enjoyed the martial arts. Seeing the comparison between what is done 
        in real life and what they are cabaple of recreating in animation is astounding to me.</p>
        <p class="intro">I'm not the best outdoorsman, but I enjoy the thrill and suspense of feeling something tugging your fishing line.</p>
        <p>I can't recall my first time being taken out fishing, but I remember going out on my own with friends and fishing the dam with nothing more than a stick, some recovered fishing line and some bait we dug up. Those were simpler times, now I have become more of an avid fisherman who enjoys the 
        rush of landing the big one. one of my favorite shows is called River Monsters and the premise is landing insanely large fish. Like the host of the show I have a desire to see and catch some of the largest fish in my area.</p>
